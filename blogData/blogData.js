    <p>In this guide, we will explore how to generate PDFs using the <strong>jsPDF</strong> library in Lightning Web Components (LWC).</p>
    
    <h2>1. Setup Your LWC Project</h2>
    <p>Before diving into jsPDF, ensure you have a Lightning Web Component project set up in Salesforce. If you don’t have one, you can create it using Salesforce CLI:</p>
    <pre><code>sfdx force:lightning:component:create –type lwc –componentname generatePDFCmp</code></pre>

    <h2>2. Install jsPDF Library</h2>
    <p>You need to include the jsPDF library in your Lightning Web Component. Since Salesforce does not support direct npm package management in LWC, download jsPDF and upload it as a static resource.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Download the jsPDF library from the <a target='_blanc' href="https://github.com/parallax/jsPDF">official jsPDF GitHub repository</a>.</li>
      <li>Go to Salesforce Setup and search for “Static Resources.”</li>
      <li>Click “New” and upload the <code>jspdf.umd.min.js</code> file. Name it <strong>jsPDFLibrary</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Create the LWC Component</h2>
    <p>Here’s a basic setup:</p>
    <h3>HTML File (generatePDFCmp.html):</h3>
    <pre><code>&lt;template&gt;
  &lt;lightning-button label="Generate PDF" onclick={generatePDF}&gt;&lt;/lightning-button&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;
    </code></pre>

    <p>We have included a Lightning Button named ‘Generate PDF.’ When clicked, it generates and downloads the PDF.</p>

    <h3>JavaScript File (generatePDFCmp.js):</h3>
    <p>First, import the jsPDF library into your component:</p>
    <pre><code>import jsPDFLibrary from '@salesforce/resourceUrl/jsPDFLibrary'; 
import { loadScript } from 'lightning/platformResourceLoader';
    </code></pre>

    <p>The <code>generatePDF()</code> method will create and download the PDF:</p>
    <pre><code>generatePDF() {
    if(this.jsPDFInitialized){
        const { jsPDF } = window.jspdf;
        const doc = new jsPDF();
        doc.text('Hello world!', 10, 10);
        doc.save('sample.pdf');
    }
}</code></pre>

    <h2>4. Common jsPDF Methods</h2>
    <p>Here are some of the common jsPDF methods you can use to generate and manipulate PDFs:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>text(text, x, y, options):</strong> Adds text to the PDF at specified coordinates.</li>
      <li><strong>save(filename):</strong> Saves the generated PDF.</li>
      <li><strong>addPage([orientation], [format]):</strong> Adds a new page to the PDF document.</li>
      <li><strong>setFontSize(size):</strong> Sets the font size for the text in the PDF.</li>
      <li><strong>setFont(fontType, fontStyle):</strong> Sets the font type and style for the text.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This example gives a high-level overview of how to integrate jsPDF in LWC components.</p>

    description: `
        <p>Salesforce Einstein Copilot, with its robust standard actions and customizable capabilities, is transforming the way businesses interact with their CRM. Join us to explore Einstein Copilot Standard and Custom Actions.</p>
        <p>Salesforce Einstein Copilot is a groundbreaking AI-powered assistant designed to seamlessly integrate into the Salesforce interface, enabling users to perform tasks through conversational interactions. This AI-driven tool is more than just a chatbot; it’s a powerful assistant that can execute business tasks, streamline workflows, and provide intelligent insights. In this post, we’ll dive deep into the two types of actions that drive Einstein Copilot—standard and custom actions—and how they can be leveraged to enhance your Salesforce experience.</p>
        
        <h2>How Einstein Copilot Works</h2>
        <p>Before we explore the actions, let’s understand the basic components of Einstein Copilot:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Copilot:</strong> The AI assistant that interacts with users through conversational language.</li>
          <li><strong>Actions:</strong> The tasks that the copilot can execute on behalf of users.</li>
          <li><strong>Reasoning Engine:</strong> The intelligent system that interprets user requests, plans actions, and executes them to achieve the desired outcome.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Standard Actions in Einstein Copilot</h2>
        <p>Standard actions come pre-built within Einstein Copilot, allowing it to perform a variety of common Salesforce tasks right out of the box. These actions are integral to the basic functionality of the copilot and are essential for everyday business operations.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Standard Actions Include</h3>
        <h4>3.1 Identify Record by Name (System Action):</h4>
        <p><strong>Functionality:</strong> Searches and retrieves Salesforce records based on a specified name, returning a list of matching record IDs.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> A sales manager asks, “Find the account records for ‘Tech Innovations,'” and Einstein Copilot quickly identifies and presents the relevant account records for review.</p>
        
        <h4>3.2 Identify Object by Name (System Action):</h4>
        <p><strong>Functionality:</strong> Determines the specific Salesforce object referenced by the user, enabling further actions on that object.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> A user types, “Show me all open cases for Tech Innovations,” and the copilot identifies that the request relates to both the Account and Case objects, guiding the user to the relevant case records.</p>
        
        <h4>3.3 Query Records (Beta):</h4>
        <p><strong>Functionality:</strong> Retrieves Salesforce records based on user-defined conditions, such as filtering by field values and sorting results.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> A sales analyst queries, “List all opportunities closing next month with a value over $50,000,” and Einstein Copilot returns a filtered list of opportunities that meet these criteria.</p>
        
        <h4>3.4 Query Records with Aggregate (Beta):</h4>
        <p><strong>Functionality:</strong> Aggregates Salesforce data to provide answers based on operations like count, sum, average, etc.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> A marketing director asks, “What’s the average deal size for opportunities closed this quarter?” and the copilot calculates and presents the average deal value.</p>
        
        <h4>3.5 Summarize Record:</h4>
        <p><strong>Functionality:</strong> Generates a concise summary of a Salesforce CRM record, highlighting key details.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> An account executive needs a quick overview of a complex deal and asks, “Summarize the key points of the Acme Corporation opportunity,” resulting in a brief summary that highlights the deal stage, key contacts, and next steps.</p>
        
        <h4>3.6 Draft or Revise Sales Email:</h4>
        <p><strong>Functionality:</strong> Automatically composes or revises a sales email, using Salesforce data to ensure personalized communication.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> A salesperson asks, “Draft a follow-up email for the lead ‘Jane Doe’ regarding our recent product demo,” and the copilot generates an email draft that references specific points discussed during the demo.</p>
        
        <h4>3.7 Answer Questions with Knowledge:</h4>
        <p><strong>Functionality:</strong> Provides answers based on information from Salesforce knowledge articles, ensuring accurate and reliable responses.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> A customer service representative asks, “What’s our policy for processing returns over 30 days?” and the copilot retrieves the relevant return policy from the knowledge base and presents it clearly.</p>
        
        <h2>Custom Actions in Einstein Copilot</h2>
        <p>While standard actions are powerful, custom actions take Einstein Copilot’s capabilities to the next level by enabling businesses to tailor the copilot to their unique needs. Custom actions are built on top of existing Salesforce functionalities, such as invocable Apex classes, autolaunched flows, and prompt templates.</p>
        
        <h3>Creating Custom Actions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Identify the Process: Determine the specific business process or workflow that needs automation.</li>
          <li>Leverage Existing Functionality: Use Salesforce Flow or Apex to create the action that will be invoked by the copilot.</li>
          <li>Integrate with Copilot: Configure the custom action in the Copilot Builder and assign it to the appropriate copilot.</li>
          <li>Test and Refine: Ensure the custom action works as intended by testing it with real data.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Examples of Custom Actions</h3>
        <h4>Get Detailed Order Status:</h4>
        <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> A support agent types, “What’s the status of order 12345?” and Einstein Copilot pulls up comprehensive details, helping the agent provide accurate information to the customer.</p>
        
        <h4>Initiate an Order Return:</h4>
        <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> A customer service rep asks, “Start a return for order 12345,” and the copilot kicks off the return process, sending the necessary information to the customer and updating the system.</p>
        
        <h4>Schedule Sales Meetings:</h4>
        <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> A sales manager requests, “Schedule a meeting with John Smith next Tuesday afternoon,” and the copilot finds an available slot, sends an invite, and updates the Salesforce record.</p>
        
        <h4>Generate Customized Proposals:</h4>
        <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> A salesperson says, “Generate a proposal for Acme Corp with our premium package,” and the copilot assembles a proposal document including all relevant details, ready for review and dispatch.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Prerequisites for Custom Copilot Action</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Verify that Einstein setup is activated in your Salesforce organization. If it’s not available, access a Trailhead playground to explore and test the functionality.</li>
          <li>In Quick Find box, search for “Einstein Settings”. Enable Einstein by toggling the switch.</li>
          <li>In Quick Find box, search for “Einstein Copilots”. Enable Einstein Copilot for Salesforce by toggling the switch.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>How the Reasoning Engine Works</h2>
        <p>The reasoning engine, also known as the planner service, is the intelligence behind Einstein Copilot. It:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Interprets User Requests: Understands the intent behind user input.</li>
          <li>Builds a Dynamic Plan: Creates a sequence of actions to achieve the user’s goal.</li>
          <li>Executes Actions: Launches the appropriate actions based on the plan.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Salesforce Einstein Copilot, with its robust standard actions and customizable capabilities, is transforming the way businesses interact with their CRM. By understanding and leveraging both standard and custom actions, organizations can optimize workflows, enhance productivity, and create a more intuitive user experience. Whether you’re automating routine tasks or developing complex workflows, Einstein Copilot is a powerful tool that can drive significant value for your business.</p>

    title: "Bulkification of Apex Triggers",
    author: "Sheima Latha",
    date: "Aug 8, 2024",
    description: `
       <p>As a leading CRM platform, Salesforce allows extensive customization to meet diverse business needs. One such powerful feature of Salesforce is Apex Triggers, which are used to perform operations before or after record modifications. However, to ensure optimal performance and avoid hitting governor limits, it’s crucial to understand and implement bulkification of triggers. This article will delve into the concept of bulkification, its importance, and how to implement it with practical examples.</p>
        <p>Bulkification refers to the practice of designing Apex code to handle multiple records at once, rather than one record at a time. This approach is essential in Salesforce due to the platform’s multi-tenant architecture, where resources are shared among many users. Governor limits are set to ensure no single user monopolizes shared resources. Bulkification helps in adhering to these limits and ensures that your code runs efficiently even when processing large data volumes.</p>
    
        <h2>Why is Bulkification Important?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> Handling multiple records in a single transaction minimizes the number of database operations, leading to faster execution.</li>
          <li><strong>Governor Limits Compliance:</strong> Salesforce imposes limits on the number of DML operations, SOQL queries, and other resources. Bulkified code is less likely to exceed these limits.</li>
          <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> As one’s organization grows and data volume increases, bulkified triggers will scale better and maintain performance.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Bulkification Best Practices</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Use Collections:</strong> Instead of operating on single records, use collections like lists, sets, or maps to process multiple records in one go.</li>
          <li><strong>Avoid SOQL/DML in Loops:</strong> Placing SOQL queries or DML operations inside loops can quickly exceed governor limits. Always move these operations outside loops.</li>
          <li><strong>Efficient Querying:</strong> Retrieve all necessary data in a single SOQL query to minimize the number of queries and avoid hitting the query limit.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Learn more about Salesforce Apex Best Practices.</p>
    
        <h2>Bulkification of Apex Triggers Example: Update Contact</h2>
        <p>Let’s consider an example scenario where the field ‘Description’ in the Contact object gets updated whenever the value in the field ‘Phone’ in the Account object is changed. A non-bulkified trigger for the above scenario would be:</p>
    
        <h3>Non-Bulkified Trigger:</h3>
        <pre><code>trigger UpdateContactsNoBulk on Account (after update) {
      for (Account acc : Trigger.new) {
        Account oldAcc = Trigger.oldMap.get(acc.Id);
        if (acc.Phone != oldAcc.Phone) {
          List&lt;Contact&gt; contacts = [SELECT Id, AccountId FROM Contact
            WHERE AccountId = :acc.Id];
          for (Contact con : contacts) {
            con.Description = 'Phone number is updated. Check the
              related Account Phone field.';
            update con;
          }
        }
      }
    }</code></pre>
    
        <p>The UpdateContactsNoBulk trigger is executed on Account when the value of ‘Phone’ is updated. First, the trigger collects the Id of the account whose phone number has been changed in a list called ‘contacts’. Then it updates the ‘Description’ field of the related contacts of that particular account by iterating the ‘contacts’ list.</p>
        
        <p>Though the above trigger works fine, there are a few problems with this trigger:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The SOQL query is inside a loop.</li>
          <li>The DML operations are performed inside a loop.</li>
          <li>The trigger is inefficient and likely to hit governor limits with large data volumes.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Bulkified Trigger:</h3>
        <pre><code>trigger UpdateContactsBulkified on Account (after update) {
      Set&lt;Id&gt; accountIds = new Set&lt;Id&gt;();
      for (Account acc : Trigger.new) {
        Account oldAcc = Trigger.oldMap.get(acc.Id);
        if (acc.Phone != oldAcc.Phone) {
          accountIds.add(acc.Id);
        }
      }
      if (!accountIds.isEmpty()) {
        List&lt;Contact&gt; contactsToUpdate = new List&lt;Contact&gt;();
        List&lt;Contact&gt; contacts = [SELECT Id, AccountId FROM Contact
          WHERE AccountId IN :accountIds];
        for (Contact con : contacts) {
          con.Description = 'Phone number is updated. Check the
            related Account Phone field.';
          contactsToUpdate.add(con);
        }
        if (!contactsToUpdate.isEmpty()) {
          update contactsToUpdate;
        }
      }
    }</code></pre>
    
        <p>In the improved trigger UpdateContactsBulkified, we have made the following modifications:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The SOQL query is outside the loop and uses a collection to handle multiple records.</li>
          <li>The DML operation is performed once on a collection of records.</li>
          <li>The trigger is efficient and adheres to governor limits, even with large data volumes.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Bulkification is a fundamental concept in Salesforce Apex programming, crucial for maintaining the performance and scalability of your applications. By following best practices such as using collections, avoiding SOQL/DML in loops, and efficient querying, you can ensure your triggers are optimized and compliant with Salesforce governor limits. Implementing these practices not only enhances the performance of your code but also ensures a seamless experience for users as your data volume grows.</p>

    title: "Lightning Web Runtime (LWR)",
    author: "Ravi Teja",
    date: "Jan 4, 2024",
    description: `
    <p>Lightning Web Runtime (LWR) empowers you to craft digital experiences tailored to the rigorous demands of contemporary web applications, encompassing scalability, security, and peak performance. At its core, LWR offers a versatile and unbiased approach to configuring and loading essential modules, services, and dependency providers essential for JavaScript app development. Its flexibility extends to deployment across diverse runtime environments, allowing adaptation to specific use cases. Whether integrated seamlessly into a local Node.js runtime or deployed as a standalone instance on platforms like Heroku, LWR ensures a robust and adaptable foundation for your application.</p>
    <h2>The architecture of LWR (Lightning Web Runtime)</h2>
    <p>Lightning Web Runtime (LWR) is the driving force behind the evolution of Experience Cloud sites, embodying a profound commitment to performance and flexibility. Its notable advancement in developer-friendliness, compared to Aura counterparts, empowers users to craft digital experiences that not only meet but exceed the high-performance and security standards of large-scale online applications. LWR’s neutral approach to configuring and loading essential JavaScript modules, services, and dependency providers streamlines the development process, offering a more intuitive and adaptable environment. Its versatility in deployment across various runtime environments, whether seamlessly integrated into a local Node.js runtime or as a standalone entity on platforms like Heroku, provides the agility needed to optimize performance and meet the unique demands of any application.

LWR sites consist of three fundamental components: an application driving the site page, a suite of plugins, and user interface-defining components. 
Notably, the framework and user interface layer remain static, ensuring rapid page loads upon site publication. During the initial site build, all static content is compiled and securely stored in the Salesforce Content Delivery Network (CDN). This strategic placement in the CDN not only optimizes delivery speed but also brings data geographically closer to visitors. 
The dynamism of the underlying data layer is preserved, sourced from the Salesforce Platform. Business processes, Salesforce records, and other live data are continuously updated in real-time. The outcome is a website that remains current with the latest information, avoiding delays associated with slow load times and offering an optimal user experience.
Experience Cloud sites developed using the Aura framework exhibit distinctions from those employing Lightning Web Runtime (LWR). Let’s delve into the primary variances between the two</p>
    <h1>Streamlined Publishing with LWR</h1>
    <p>Unlike Aura templates, Lightning Web Runtime (LWR) optimizes speed by caching components during site publication, ensuring sub-second content delivery. While Aura dynamically loads components, LWR’s static serving requires a site republish for changes to take effect, offering unparalleled speed in return.</p>

    <h2>Authentication Simplified</h2>
    <p>LWR sites offer the choice between authenticated and unauthenticated setups. Notably, unauthenticated LWR sites streamline URLs by eliminating the ‘/s’—in contrast to Aura, where authenticated sites include it (e.g., https://mycustomdomain.com/s/mypage). Opting for unauthenticated LWR allows for cleaner, more straightforward domain names (e.g., https://mycustomdomain.com/mypage).</p>

    <h2>Style Empowerment</h2>
    <p>LWR introduces upgraded accessibility standards, featuring F6 navigation for seamless region traversal with a single keystroke, reducing the need for multiple tab strokes. Define user regions, such as header and footer. Additionally, LWR’s single-page HTML application architecture enhances screen reader capabilities, dynamically adapting to theme changes and intelligently resetting to the page’s top when content shifts.</p>

    <h2>How to Create an LWR Site?</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Navigation:</strong> 
        <ul>
          <li>Go to Setup and use the Quick Find box to locate “Digital Experiences.”</li>
          <li>Select “All Sites” and click “New” to initiate the site creation process.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Site Type Selection:</strong> 
        <p>Within the site creation wizard, choose either “Build Your Own (LWR)” or “Microsite (LWR).” Click “Get Started” to proceed with the selected site type.</p>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Configuration:</strong> 
        <p>Provide a distinctive name and set a base URL for your site.</p>
        <p>The base URL supplements the domain established during Digital Experiences activation. For instance, if your domain is UniversalTelco.my.site.com and you’re establishing a partner site, input “partners” to create a unique URL like UniversalTelco.my.site.com/partners.</p>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Finalization:</strong> 
        <p>Click “Create” to commence the site creation process.</p>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Post-Creation:</strong> 
        <p>Once the site is successfully created, you’ll gain access to the Experience Workspaces area.</p>

    title: "How to Write Test Cases?",
    author: "Sheima Latha",
    date: "May 16, 2024",
    description: `
    <p>Test cases play a vital role in the quality of the system functionalities by verifying that all functionalities are properly incorporated. Let’s explore how to write effective test cases. Join us to learn about how to write test cases in Salesforce.</p>
    <h2>What is a Test Case?</h2>
        <p>A test case is a step-by-step process that includes the expected results to verify a specific system functionality. A test scenario is a real-world situation where the system functionality is used. The vast majority of test scenarios that a user might run into when utilizing the system in the actual world are covered by the test cases that are prepared by the developers to improve the system quality.</p>
        
        <p>Test cases are written to ensure that all the functionalities incorporated in the system work seamlessly, to assess the data visibility for different users, to check if permission sets and profiles are assigned aptly to all the system users, and to verify whether the page layout assignments, object and record accessibilities, compact layouts, and other configurations are set correctly. Based on the test cases provided by the developers, the end-users evaluate the system during User Acceptance Testing (UAT).</p>
    
        <h2>How to Write Test Cases?</h2>
        <p>It is advisable to craft the test cases on spreadsheets (Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets) rather than on word processing applications for easy readability. The test case sheet consists of the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Test Case ID</li>
          <li>Test Scenario Description</li>
          <li>User Profile/Role</li>
          <li>Steps</li>
          <li>Expected Result</li>
          <li>Status (Pass/Fail)</li>
          <li>Test Cycle 1: Tester Name</li>
          <li>Test Cycle 1: Tested Date</li>
          <li>Test Cycle 1: Comments and Screenshot Explaining the Issue</li>
          <li>Test Cycle 1: Developer Name and Comments</li>
          <li>Test Cycle 2: Tester Name</li>
          <li>Test Cycle 2: Tested Date</li>
          <li>Test Cycle 2: Comments and Screenshot Explaining the Issue</li>
          <li>Test Cycle 2: Developer Name and Comments</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>These are not the only things contained in a test case document. Along with these, if any prerequisites are required before evaluating the system or specific functionality, then feel free to include them in the document.</p>
    
        <h3>Sample Test Case</h3>
        <p>If there are too many steps for a single test scenario, split that into smaller scenarios and write the steps accordingly. For instance:</p>
        <blockquote>
          Original Scenario: “Verify if the user is able to convert a lead to an account.” The above scenario can be split as follows:
          <ul>
            <li>Create a new Lead record with relevant information.</li>
            <li>Qualify the Lead by updating its status and adding more necessary details.</li>
            <li>Convert the Lead to an Account, Contact, and Opportunity.</li>
            <li>Verify that the Account, Contact, and Opportunity records are created with accurate data mappings.</li>
            <li>Confirm that the Lead record is marked as converted and associated with the new records.</li>
          </ul>
        </blockquote>
    
        <p>The acceptable range for the number of steps per test case is 15 – 20. Having more steps than this may cause users to be overwhelmed and struggle to follow the instructions for evaluating a single functionality.</p>
    
        <h3>So Far, We Learnt</h3>
        <p>We learned the concept of test cases and how to write them effectively along with a few examples. By following best practices and guidelines for test case writing, one can save time and resources in the long run, reduce the risk of errors, and improve the overall user experience.</p>

    title: "Global Extension Point Classes for B2B Commerce for Visualforce",
    author: "",
    date: "",
    description: `<p>B2B Commerce for Visualforce provides several global extension points: Apex classes that are called from other code in the managed package and execute specific business logic for certain storefront functionality. For example, several extension point classes define behavior for loading data during checkout.</p>
    <h3>Note</h3>
    <p>Some extension point classes are deprecated, but are still available in the managed package for compatibility with legacy subscriber code.</p>
    <p>Sometimes, B2B Commerce for Visualforce updates extension point classes in a new version of the B2B Commerce managed package. In subscriber code, you reference the latest version of these classes that's available in your version of the managed package.</p>

    <h2>Extend a Global Extension Point Class</h2>
    <p>To implement custom business logic for your organization, you can write subscriber code that extends a default extension point class.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>ccrz.cc_api_CartExtension:</strong> Implement subscriber-defined behavior for processing and validating cart data. This class defines a mixture of legacy and current behavior, and the <em>ccrz.ccLogicCartValidate</em> logic service provider class replaces the legacy functionality from this class.</li>
      <li><strong>ccrz.cc_api_DeliveryDate:</strong> Implement subscriber-defined behavior for showing an account's available delivery dates during checkout. On the storefront, the Checkout page calls this extension point class before rendering shipping options.</li>
      <li><strong>ccrz.cc_api_OutboundOrderCancel:</strong> Implement subscriber-defined behavior for determining whether a buyer can cancel an order from the My Orders section of the My Account page.</li>
      <li><strong>ccrz.cc_api_PriceAdjustment:</strong> Implement subscriber-defined behavior for customizing price information on legacy versions of the Shopping Cart page or Checkout page.</li>
      <li><strong>ccrz.cc_api_ProductQuantityRule:</strong> Define the quantity increments that a buyer can use when adding or updating cart items. For example, you may want to require buyers to purchase a certain product only in increments of five.</li>
      <li><strong>ccrz.cc_api_ShippingAndHandling:</strong> Implement subscriber-defined behavior for populating the available shipping methods during checkout. On the storefront, the Checkout page calls this extension point class before rendering shipping options.</li>
      <li><strong>ccrz.cc_hk_Catalog:</strong> Return info from your product catalog used for populating autocomplete suggestions on the storefront.</li>
      <li><strong>ccrz.cc_hk_Category (Deprecated):</strong> Dynamically construct the category tree for a storefront by querying cached category data.</li>
      <li><strong>ccrz.cc_hk_DynamicTheme:</strong> Load a unique storefront theme based on the current buyer's account group.</li>
      <li><strong>ccrz.cc_hk_EffectiveAccount:</strong> Return and filter effective accounts that a buyer can access other than the buyer's default assigned account. Update the active shopping cart for a selected effective account.</li>
      <li><strong>ccrz.cc_hk_Invoice:</strong> Create and return data for an invoice after a buyer completes a storefront purchase, and process payments associated with invoices.</li>
      <li><strong>ccrz.cc_hk_Menu:</strong> Dynamically construct the menu hierarchy for a storefront's navigation bar by querying cached menu data.</li>
      <li><strong>ccrz.cc_hk_Order:</strong> Implement subscriber-defined behavior for placing an order, reordering, and showing order history. This class defines a mixture of legacy and current behavior, and the order logic service provider classes replace the legacy functionality from this class.</li>
      <li><strong>ccrz.cc_hk_Payment:</strong> Evaluate and maintain stored payments and transaction payments.</li>
      <li><strong>ccrz.cc_hk_Pricing:</strong> Implement subscriber-defined behavior for pricing products, including entitlements, contracts, and other price rules. This class defines a legacy behavior. For new implementations, extend the <em>ccrz.ccLogicProductPricing</em> logic service provider instead.</li>
      <li><strong>ccrz.cc_hk_SSO:</strong> Implement subscriber-defined behavior for overriding default storefront URLs, such as to add a single sign-on (SSO) service for logging in.</li>
      <li><strong>ccrz.cc_hk_Subscriptions:</strong> Implement subscriber-defined behavior for overriding the default business logic for processing subscriptions and creating installment orders.</li>
      <li><strong>ccrz.cc_hk_TaxCalculation:</strong> Calculate the tax amount on a particular cart from the Order Review section of the storefront's Checkout page. The calculated tax is based on the taxable products included in the cart and the cart's shipping address.</li>
      <li><strong>ccrz.cc_hk_UserInterface:</strong> Specify the JavaScript and CSS libraries referenced in each storefront page, including standard includes, proprietary libraries, and theme-specific files in a static resource.</li>

    description: `<p>Join us to learn about how to avoid DML from For Loop in Salesforce? To avoid DML (Data Manipulation Language) statements inside a for loop in Salesforce, you can use the bulk update technique. This technique involves creating a list of records that need to be updated and then updating them all at once outside the for loop.</p>
    <h1>Why DML should not be written inside for loop?</h1>
    <p>The well-known Salesforce governor limit concerns the number of DML operations in a single transaction. As per the docs, the limit is 150.</p>

    <p>Here is one simple code that will give you the “<strong>Too Many DML Statements: 151</strong>” error.</p>

    <pre><code>
    for (Integer i = 0; i < 150; i++){    
       Account accountObject = new Account();  
       accountObject.Name = 'Test ' + i;    
       insert accountObject;
    }
    </code></pre>

    <h2>How to fix Too Many DML Statements: 151</h2>
    <p>You should not use a DML statement inside for loops and leverage collections to store the data. When you do a DML operation on a collection, it only counts as one DML!</p>

    <pre><code>
    List<Account> accountList = new List<Account>();
    for (Integer i = 0; i < 150; i++){    
       Account accountObject = new Account();  
       accountObject.Name = ‘Test ‘ + i;  
       accountList.add(accountObject);  
    }
    insert accountList;
    </code></pre>

    <p>In the example above, we first create an empty list called <code>accountList</code>. Then, we loop through all the accounts and update their names. Instead of updating each account inside the loop, we add them to the <code>accountList</code> list. After the loop, we update all the accounts in the <code>accountList</code> list in a single DML statement outside the loop.</p>

    <p>This avoids the DML statement inside the for loop, which can cause performance issues and governor limit exceptions in Salesforce. By using the bulk update technique, you can improve the efficiency and performance of your code in Salesforce.</p>

    <h2>How to avoid DML from For Loop in Salesforce</h2>
    <p>There are a few other solutions you can follow to fix the DML inside for loop issue:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Bulkify your code:</strong> The first principle is writing code for multiple records simultaneously. We should write scalable code and avoid hitting the governor limits.</li>
      <li><strong>Use Collection:</strong> You can use List and Map in Salesforce to avoid SOQL and DML inside the for loop.</li>
      <li><strong>Follow Salesforce Apex Best Practice:</strong> Learn about Salesforce Apex best practices to avoid any governor limit in Salesforce.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What is the DML limit in Salesforce flow?</h2>
    <p>The total number of DML statements issued is 150 in flow, and the total number of records processed due to DML statements is 10,000. Learn more <a href="#">here</a>.</p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>DML statements should not be used inside loops. Learn different ways to overcome Salesforce Governor Limits using Platform Events.</p>

    author: "Gobinath A",
    date: "Feb 8, 2024",
    description: ` <p>Apex is a powerful programming language used in Salesforce for developing custom applications and automating business processes. This tutorial aims to provide beginners with a solid understanding of the core fundamentals of Apex coding, including key concepts and syntax. Let’s start the Understanding the Core Fundamentals of Apex for Salesforce: A Starter’s Tutorial.</p>
    <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Variables and Data Types</strong> are fundamental building blocks in Apex coding.</li>
      <li><strong>Control Structures</strong> help in controlling the flow of execution in Apex code.</li>
      <li><strong>Exception Handling</strong> is crucial for managing errors and unexpected situations in Apex programs.</li>
      <li><strong>Methods and Classes</strong> are essential components for organizing code in Apex development.</li>
      <li><strong>Triggers and Governor Limits</strong> play a significant role in governing the behavior and limits of Apex code execution.</li>
    </ul>
     <h2>Key Concepts of Apex Coding</h2>
    <h3>Variables and Data Types</h3>
    <p>
      In Apex, variables are basic units of storage. Apex is a statically typed language, so variables must be declared with a type. 
      Primitive data types include <strong>Integer, Double, Boolean, String</strong>, while complex types include <strong>sObjects</strong> and collections like <strong>List, Set, Map</strong>.
    </p>
    <h3>Control Structures</h3>
    <p>
      Control structures manage the flow of execution in Apex. These include:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>If/Else:</strong> Conditional statements to execute code blocks.</li>
        <li><strong>For, While, Do-While:</strong> Loops for repetitive tasks.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Exception Handling</h3>
    <p>
      Exception handling uses <strong>try, catch, finally</strong> blocks to manage errors. This ensures robust and error-resistant code.
    </p>
    <h3>Methods and Classes</h3>
    <p>
      Methods are reusable blocks of code, while classes provide structure for creating objects. A class can include attributes, methods, and constructors for initialization.
    </p>
    <h3>Triggers</h3>
    <p>
      Triggers are actions that execute before or after DML events like insert, update, and delete on Salesforce records. There are <strong>Before</strong> and <strong>After</strong> triggers.
    </p>
    <h3>Governor Limits</h3>
    <p>
      Apex is subject to Salesforce's governor limits, such as limits on DML statements, SOQL queries, and heap size. Code must be optimized to avoid these limits.
    </p>
    <h2>Best Practices in Apex Development</h2>
    <h3>Code Optimization</h3>
    <p>
      Code should be bulkified to handle multiple records at once. Avoid SOQL queries and DML operations inside loops.
    </p>
    <h3>Testing Strategies</h3>
    <p>
      Write tests that cover a range of scenarios and maintain high test coverage. Use mocking and independent tests for robustness.
    </p>
    <h3>Security Considerations</h3>
    <p>
      Ensure that object- and field-level permissions are enforced. Protect sensitive data by validating inputs and following security best practices.
    </p>
    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>What are the key concepts to understand in Apex coding?</strong> Variables, control structures, and exception handling.</li>
      <li><strong>How can I optimize my code in Apex development?</strong> Use bulk operations, avoid inefficient loops, and manage governor limits.</li>
